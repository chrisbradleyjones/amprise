# Audio Visualizer in [Range Engine](https://rangeengine.tech)

*"ok."*
I made a few adjustments to [BluePrintRandom](https://github.com/BluePrintRandom/amprise)'s audio visualizer.
***
*"What is actually in the file?"*

 - Objects reacting to audio
 - Text object showing the value of the visualization

Thanks to [BluePrintRandom](https://github.com/BluePrintRandom) for the code and helping me with it!
